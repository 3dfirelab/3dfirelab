<span style="color:#D35400">Rationale:</span>
New developments in wildland fire modeling aim to better simulate fire front complex geometry when predicting its spread over the landscape during operational monitoring support. For example, coupled fire-atmosphere modeling systems can now simulate simultaneously the fire front spread and the induced plume, therefore including effects from fire-induced convection in the fire front propagation. With this same objective, new data assimilation algorithms are now developed to improve fire front position model prediction based on available observations. To help validate those developments, landscape-scale observations of experimental fire are crucial.

<span style="color:#D35400">Objectives:</span>
This workshop proposes to draw the current state of the art in monitoring experimental fire. A particular interest is pushed on small to moderate experimental fire size that can be easily organized and use to collect data at relatively low cost and high spatial and temporal resolution.  
The aim of the workshop is to write a review  with all participants based on the current measuring capabilities  to draw the clear interest of small scale fire in the large context of fire remote sensing.
  
<span style="color:#D35400">Organization:</span>
A hybrid organization is planned, both in person and on line. Number of participant to be determined.

<span style="color:#D35400">Date:</span> targeting the Week of the 26th of Sep 2022.
