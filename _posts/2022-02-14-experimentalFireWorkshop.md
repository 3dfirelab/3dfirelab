<span style="color:#D35400">Premise:</span>
Despite the existence of numerous historical experimental dataset, experimental burning remains a critical component of wildfire research. With the acceleration of new technologies, modelling techniques and questions to be answered, the need for tailored experiments remains ever present and arguably more necessary than ever.

<span style="color:#D35400">Rationale:</span>
New developments in wildland fire modeling aim to better simulate fire front complex geometry when predicting its spread over the landscape during operational monitoring support. For example, coupled fire-atmosphere modeling systems can now simulate simultaneously the fire front spread and the induced plume, therefore including effects from fire-induced convection in the fire front propagation. With this same objective, new data assimilation algorithms are now developed to improve fire front position model prediction based on available observations. To help validate those developments, landscape-scale observations of experimental fire are crucial.

<span style="color:#D35400">Objectives:</span>
This workshop proposes to capture the current state of the art in monitoring experimental fires. A particular interest is placed on small to moderate sized experimental fires that can be easily organized and use to collect data at relatively low cost and high spatial and temporal resolution.  
The workshop will be summarized by writing a review article with all participants based on the current measuring capabilities and objectives to illustrate the unique value of small scale fires in the larger context of wildfire research.

<span style="color:#D35400">Organization:</span>
A hybrid organization is planned, both in person and on line. Number of participant to be determined.
