From the 11 to the 18 of Novembre 2022, the [IX international conference on Fores Fire Research](https://www.adai.pt/newevent/event/home/index.php?target=home&defLang=2&event=4) was oragnized in Coimbra
by the group of Prof Domingos Viegas.

The week started with 2 courses on fire safety and fire behavior, followed by 5 days of talks
on various topics of fire science considering studies of smoldering/flaming interactions at 10 mm scale to climate change effect on fire season evolution at global scale.

During that week, I presented a work on the use of field scale fire monitoring and atmospheric modeling to retreive local information of fire behavior and wind field at the fire front location. The following video presents the slides of this talk.
